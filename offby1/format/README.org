#+TITLE: Format Module
#+DATE: December 25, 2025

Placeholder module for format-all configuration and extensions.

* Description
This module is currently a minimal placeholder for configuring the =format-all= package
and related code formatting behavior. It provides a structured location for future
formatting customizations.

* Module Flags
/This module has no flags./

* Current State
The module contains only a skeleton =config.el= file with copyright and author information,
but no active configuration. The =packages.el= file is empty.

This suggests the module was created as a placeholder for future format-all customizations
but hasn't been actively developed yet.

* Future Enhancements
Potential future additions to this module could include:

** Format-all Configuration
- Custom formatter selections per language
- Hook configurations for auto-formatting
- Integration with LSP formatting

** Language-specific Formatters
- Prettier for web languages
- Black or ruff for Python
- rustfmt for Rust
- gofmt or goimports for Go

** Formatting Policies
- Configure when to format (on save, manually, etc.)
- Per-project formatting rules
- Integration with .editorconfig
