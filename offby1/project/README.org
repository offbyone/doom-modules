shell utilities for executing project-specific tasks.

* Module Flags
- =+conner= :: Enable Conner project command runner
- =+dwim= :: Enable DWIM (Do What I Mean) shell commands

* Features
** Conner Integration
When =+conner= is enabled, provides intelligent project command running through Conner.

*** Smart Command Dispatch
The module rebinds =SPC p != (projectile compile) to intelligently choose between:
- Without prefix: =conner-run-project-command= (structured command menu)
- With prefix (=C-u=): =projectile-compile-project= (traditional compile command)

This gives you quick access to project-specific commands while retaining the ability
to run arbitrary shell commands when needed.

** DWIM Shell Commands
When =+dwim= is enabled, provides =dwim-shell-command= for smart, template-based shell commands.

* Installation
Enable the module with desired flags in your =init.el=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(doom! :offby1
       (project +conner +dwim))
#+end_src

Then run:
#+begin_src shell
doom sync
#+end_src

* Usage
** Conner Commands
With =+conner= enabled:

#+begin_example
SPC p !      ; Run Conner project command (menu-based)
C-u SPC p !  ; Run arbitrary shell command (traditional)
#+end_example

Conner will present a menu of project-specific commands defined in your project
configuration (e.g., =.conner.yaml= or similar).

** DWIM Shell Commands
With =+dwim= enabled:

#+begin_example
M-x dwim-shell-command
#+end_example

Execute context-aware shell commands with templates.

* Configuration
** Conner Project Commands
Configure project commands in your project root. Example =.conner.yaml=:

#+begin_src yaml
commands:
  test: npm test
  build: npm run build
  lint: npm run lint
#+end_src

(Exact configuration format depends on Conner's spec)
